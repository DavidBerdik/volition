Hi, I am your readme. It is best to update me with directions on how to setup, configure, and run your project.


SETUP

To setup the project on your local machine, first ensure that you have Android Studio installed.
After installing android studio, clone this repository onto your machine by copying the repository
URL from the "clone" button on bitbucket. Then, inside Android Studio, you can import the cloned 
project. Ensure that it builds successfully before starting development.
